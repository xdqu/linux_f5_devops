How To Export Share Public Key
To share your key as a file, we need to export it from the gpg local key store. To do this, we’ll use the --export option, which must be followed by the email address that you used to generate the key. The --output option must be followed by the name fo the file you wish to have the key exported into. The --armor option tells gpg to generate ASCII armor output instead of a binary file.

For example: 
gpg2 --output /var/tmp/GPG2_filename.key --armor --export <email address>


How To Encrypting Files
The --encrypt option tells gpg to encrypt the file, and the --sign option tells it to sign the file with your details. The --armor option tells gpg to create an ASCII file. The -r (recipient) option must be followed by the email address of the person you’re sending the file to.

For example:
gpg2 --encrypt --sign --armor /var/tmp/gpg2_test.txt -r <recipient email address>
gpg --encrypt --sign --armor /var/tmp/gpg2_test.txt -r <recipient email address>


How To Decrypting Files

We can decrypt it very easily using the --decrypt option. We are going to redirect the output into another file called gpg2_test_plain.txt.

Note that we don’t have to tell gpg who the file is from. It can work that out from the encrypted contents of the file.

gpg2 --decrypt /var/tmp/gpg2_test.txt.asc > /var/tmp/gpg2_test_plain.txt
